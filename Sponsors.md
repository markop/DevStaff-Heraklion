# Sponsors

We thought long and hard about accepting sponsorships. You will find our thinking in the “History” section, at the end of this page. 

_These days, it seems, everyone has some advertisement targeted to software developers..._

Below you will find the available sponsorship packages / options: 

## DevStaff Swag Sponsor
Help the community members wear the DevStaff community name with pride! With this option, you will sponsor the purchase of promotional material with the DevStaff brand, in return for awareness of your own brand.  (Please note we do not currently offer a co-branding option, see below for awareness benefits). All material will be made available to community and org team members.

The swag pack will be awarded to lucky attendees through a lottery that will take place at the end of the meetup. Your company will be publicly thanked for making this possible. 

The swag pack will include: 
* a dev-friendly cool looking t-shirt, 
* “Raki” / “Tsikoudia” shot glasses! (we are the definitive developer community in Crete after all) 
* (optionally) any other item that can fit in the budget

Here’s how the swag draw will work: 
* 5 swag packs will be awarded at each meetup
* Each pack costs 20 EUR
* 100 EUR buys us 5 packs - i.e. awareness for you for ONE meetup. 
* 200 EUR buys us 10 packs - i.e. awareness for you for TWO meetups. 
* 400 EUR buys us 20 packs - i.e. awareness for you for FOUR meetups. 

The list below describes the awareness benefits that our branding sponsor receives in return:
* leaflets (can be left on table at entrance),
* “Thank you” message by organizers during Meetup (not by company),
* “Thank you” message during Swag Pack draw
* “Thank you” mention in facebook page post.

Note: the invoices will be issued directly to the sponsoring company by our own suppliers. 

## DevStaff Laptop Stickers Sponsor
No developer laptop is complete without laptop stickers. A “badge of honor” for many, a hipster trend for some… but the reality is that laptop stickers are highly sought after! 

Estimated cost: ~300 EUR for 500 stickers

The list below describes the awareness benefits that our stickers sponsor receives in return:
* leaflets (can be left on table at entrance),
* “Thank you” message by organizers during Meetup (not by company),
* “Thank you” message in every meetup, as long as we still have stickers to give away.
* “Thank you” mention in facebook page post.

Note: the invoices will be issued directly to the sponsoring company by our own suppliers. 


## Catering Sponsor
At the end of every meetup we have a networking session that offers - perhaps - the greatest value of our meetups: getting to know other professionals who might be able to advance your career forward, help out with an annoying problem you’ve been dealing with, or, in time, even become your friends. 

A sponsorship package of 100 EUR / meetup helps our meetup attendees satisfy their hunger and thirst, all in the good name of your company. 


The list below describes the awareness benefits that our catering sponsor receives in return:
* leaflets (can be left on table at entrance),
* online banner on DevStaff website (with back-link do-follow),
* “Thank-you” message by organizers during Meetup (not by company),
* Sponsor’s slide in DevStaff Welcome presentation,
* “Thank you” mention in facebook page post.

## Venue Sponsor
High quality human interactions happen more naturally in a nice setting. The venue is one of the most important factors that go into running successful meet-ups. 

We want venues that are accessible, large enough for our size and provide the necessary equipment (e.g. fast internet connection, projector, comfortable seating, etc.) to help our meet-ups run smoothly. You can find more details in [this relevant discussion](https://github.com/devstaff-crete/DevStaff-Heraklion/issues/185). 

The list below describes the awareness benefits that our venue sponsor receives in return:
* leaflets (can be left on table at entrance),
* online banner on DevStaff website (with back-link do-follow),
* “Thank-you” message by organizers during Meetup (not by company),
* Sponsor’s slide in DevStaff Welcome presentation,
* “Thank you” mention in facebook page post.

## Logo Sponsor
We like changes so we are open to new proposals for a new logo. We are focusing on some 'rebranding' of DevStaff and a new Logo is the most prominent starting point of this trip. 

So we want some Logo proposals for the DevStaff Community! We are truly open to any proposal so feel free to contact us!

The list below describes the awareness benefits that our Logo sponsor receives in return:
* online banner on DevStaff Sponsors page website (with back-link do-follow) for 3 months,
* “Thank you” mention in facebook & Twitter page post,
* “Thank-you” message by organizers during Meetup (not by company/individual).

## How to contact us about Sponsorship opportunities
Depending on the time of year and ongoing sponsor engagements, some, or all, of the above options may or may not be available. Please contact us at info @t devstaff d0t gr, so you can get in touch with the Org Team and discuss the available options. 

## History 
After several Org Team Meetups on the topic, we reached a consensus that we will only open up a Catering sponsorship, 
so that we can have some snacks & drinks for every meetup. 

In addition, after the discussion in [this issue](https://github.com/devstaff-crete/DevStaff-Heraklion/issues/185) and several org meetups, we also opened the possibility of a Venue Sponsor, as long as they can provide their venue for free and without any unreasonable demands. 

### Sponsor Eligibility
We did discuss about whether this sponsorship should be open to IT companies at all (so that we wouldn't face any competition / 
conflict of interest issues), however, we agreed that we will not place any explicit constraints for the time being. 

To clarify, this does not mean we are opening our doors to **any** sponsor (for example, in the case where we had a single 
sponsorship offer from <name-some-unethical-company-here>, we would be forced to accept it), rather that we are not explicitly
excluding any companies from offering a sponsorship. 

In general, we will only accept sponsorships from companies the Org Team approves. We would prefer not having any sponsors at all (considering we could still run our meet-ups without them) than having some sponsor the community would feel uneasy about.
